CycleCross

// To add a crosshair:
// Create a file with your crosshair commands e.g. ExampleCross.cfg
// Put it in the "sw1tch" folder where this autoexec is located and
// create a new line between the latest Crosshair and "bind "n" CycleCross"
// put "alias Cross3 "exec sw1tch\ExampleCross.cfg; alias CycleCross "Cross1""
// For every crosshair you add, you'll have to point the previous towards the new
// Crosshair and the new towards the first.

// #### VIEWMODEL ####
// Has now been moved to its own file for ease of editing/access. 
exec sw1tch\viewmodel.cfg

// #### QUICKSWITCH #### (Behavior is: Hold to keep knife out, release to goto last weapon used. Tapping it once is the fastest possible quickswitch. Though it still won't let you shoot faster in GO.)

// #### BOMB FIND SCRIPT (Drop Mechanic for T side) #### (Uses in-game hint system to show you where bomb is on the *correct* site. This will not direct you to which site it is, and you must be on site for it to work. Useful for smokes.)

// #### TAUNTS #### (10.3 Update: Created and moved to own file.)
// You must now hold a button (currently \) to activate taunts.
// While the file is harder to edit, it provides greater flexibility of those keys
// much like the buy binds. 
// In the future I would like pages of binds to cycle between, but that's a lottttt of work.
