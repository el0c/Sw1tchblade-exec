echo "Changelog:"
echo "	#### V10.3.1 ####"
echo "	- Fixed Issues with TeamEquipment Implementiontation."
echo "	- Investigating a sound change for the Damage Indicator Script"
echo ""
echo "	#### V10.4 ####"
echo "	- Moved all required dependecies into a seperate folder for easier"
echo "	  ease of access and updating."
echo "	- Added Master and Voice Volume Controls"
echo "	  Defaults are:" 
echo "	  Up/Down = Master"
echo "	  Left(lower)/Right(higher) = Voice"
echo "	- Separated Cleanup into its own file. This is for a couple of reasons"
echo "	  Chief among them being, ease of changes without breaking the overall file"
echo "	  As well as the ability to disable/remove it entirely from the process."
echo "	  There's a number of changes I wanted to attempt that involve the same process"
echo "	  as how the Display Damage Script functions. Thinks the 'communications jammed'"
echo "	  without saying that in Team Chat, but to just yourself."
echo "	- Removed Graphics from Autoexec Startup, put them into their own file."
echo "	- Further changes to the sound aspect of things is coming, from notifications to "
echo "	  overall sound settings."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Clutch mode no longer alerts your team. This simply avoids the salt"
echo "	  when you have teammates whom question why it's 'Communications Jammed' and it further detracts"
echo "	  from the game."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Quick switch will no longer switch back to your primary"
echo "	  weapon (i.e., your AK/M4) when you want to quick switch to knife and back."
echo "	  The reasoning behind this is a few things:"
echo "	  some people have a (bad, myself included^*) habit of quick switching on our reloads"
echo "	  cause of older games or "Pro."  
echo "	  This will allow us to do that on pistols without it returning to our primary."
echo "	  Little known fact: When you start to reload in CS, the full sound will play for enemies."
echo "	  **What this means:** You can start to reload an AK, quick switch right after and bait"
echo "	  the enemy in Dust2 upper Tuns whom flashed but isn't pushing. Fuck that guy."
echo "	  (For those interested, I mentioned it was a bad habit because it was proven to be"
echo "	   ineffective for increasing the speed of a reload to any useful degree. See:"
echo "	   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8S0t2Ep30 "
echo "	   and https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2t641d/does_quick_switching_actually_reduce_reload_time/"
echo "	   A quick way to test would be the FAMAS, it's time would be significantly reduced; but isn't.)
echo ""
echo "	#### V11.0 ####"
echo "	- Made autoexec sections dramatically easier to find. (Thanks /u/festinuz)"
echo "	  These changes will happen to other files over time as needed."
echo "	- **Introducing... NOTIFICATIONS**"
echo "	  'What are these?' you ask. Well, (also thanks to /u/festinuz/)"
echo "	  with some slight modification, adjustment and additions/reductions"
echo "	  I've finally used the 'Developer' command to show multiple outputs."
echo "	  I had the idea alone, but I was beaten to the punch and I don't know if I"
echo "	  could've gotten there alone. But alas, it functions. And has changed startup!"
echo "					**'But, what does this mean for me?'**"
echo "					    I'm glad you asked. It means:"
echo "		- The volume control scripts now have indicators for their precise volume"
echo "		- Your damage is printed when you die by default, no more missed output. "
echo "		- Your mute button still alerts you, but only you. No more 'What the fuck"
echo "		  is communications jammed?'"
echo "		- You can disable these notifications."
echo "	- '-console' is no longer required or recommended on startup of CS."
echo "	  There is still an indication it executed in the top left when you start."
echo "	  This was made with the same principal as the other notifications and serves"
echo "	  to both fix bugs, and create some semblance to earlier versions."
echo "	  The original art is now available using the 'autocredits' command."
echo "	- 'cleanup' has had a rough time these past few versions. So it's time to part"
echo "	  ways. We wish it well in it's next duties in RAM before it is overwritten and"
echo "	  lost forever. "
echo "	  (These were removed because, it turns out they weren't doing much. In fact,"
echo "	   only three of them worked at once. The others overwrote the prior. I thought"
echo "	   you were able to filter out multiple things, but I was incorrect in my method.)"
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Voice Mute button is now 'Page Down.'"
echo "	- **Keybind Added:** Notifications toggle is now 'Page Up.'"
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Redeploy no longer toggles console. Redploy AND run! Wow!"
echo "	- **Command added:** autocredits"
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Returned Team and All chat to defaults. Sorry!"
echo "	- **Format Change:** Changelog has no been flipped to show relevant information"
echo "	  first because of how it prints this information."
echo "	- There's a bug where information will start printing while trying to read this page. "
echo "	  Not a whole lot I can think to do atm. Shouldn't be a big deal for everything else."
echo "	  I'm not fond of the nuclear approach of stopping all output. This doesn't interfere"
echo "	  with function whatsoever."
echo ""
echo "	#### V11.5 ####"
echo "	- Minor Text Fixes"
echo "	- Improved, exchanged some insults."
echo "	  Y, U, Semicolon, / and Brackets now have taunts."
echo "	  J, I, L, P, . have been updated with new insults."
echo "	- Fixed the bug that required "player : yourname line"
echo "	  to be displayed with the damage script. Now it'll"
echo "	  function on startup as well as filter the 'Your Mom'"
echo "	  command."
echo "	- Added a 'guide' when holding down the Buy Binds key."
echo "	  A list of the items bound will be shown. If you update"
echo "	  the items within the buybinds.cfg, you will need to make changes"
echo "	  to printlist.cfg as well to accurately reflect your preferences."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** 4 will now always select decoy over other grenades."
echo "	  However, it's old cycling behavior is available when you do not have a decoy."
echo "	  This was added because we have the other nade quickswith keys, but didn't have"
echo "	  a key bound for just the decoy. Not wanting to remove everyone's playstyle, I opted"
echo "	  to mix them. Hopefully this allows more fine tune control as well as familiar muscle"
echo "	  memory in those clutch situations (when you don't forget you picked up a decoy >_>)"
echo "	  Alternatively, you could just use ZXC and LALT to pick your nades and use 4 for decoy only..."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** T will now drop bomb on T side. (It will drop like a drop key when you don't have bomb)"
echo "	  This is your bomb find key, so it will still 'function,' 
echo "	  but it just uses the in-game hint system and they don't provide useful info for anything on T"
echo ""
echo "	#### V12 ####"
echo "	- Moderate Text Fixes."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Taunt key now displays a list of taunts in the top left, much like buy binds."
echo "	- **Keybind Added:** Enter is now bound to switching taunt pages while holding the taunt key."
echo "	  This key remains unbound when the taunt key is released."
echo "	- **Feature Update:** PAGED TAUNTS"
echo "	  	- Default Taunts you know and love."
echo "	  	- Unicode Emotes!"
echo "	  	- Spicy Memes and Extended Insults!"
echo "	  	- Team binds for when you're micless!"
echo "	- Fixed bugs."
echo "	- Added more bugs to fix later.
echo ""
echo " #### V12.1 ####
echo " - Fixed a bug that caused Buybinds to make 4 behave incorrectly after they were used."
echo " - **Behavior Change:** Minimap now starts zoomed out, and is a toggle not a hold."
echo " - Removed some redundancies, moved cl_righthand 0 to viewmodel."
echo " - An art update for when you launch, redeploy is in the works. Stay tuned."
echo " - Added some useful commands for deathmatch and community servers like "Don't buy random weapons"
echo "	 and "ignore these shitty community server MOTDs."
echo ""
echo "	#### V13 ####"
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Taunt switcher now displays page info on switch instead of page title."
echo "	  This allows you to see what does what without repressing the taunt key."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Buy Binds now have a 'Drop Mode.' i.e. When you purchase a weapon it will"
echo "	  automatically be selected and thrown the direction you're looking. This is useful to let you buy"
echo "	  that P250 for Orange (it's always fucking orange) without fumbling around the buy menu."
echo "	  This mode is enabled by Pressing F12, at which time your Buy Binds will change to indicate what"
echo "	  key drops what."
echo "	- **Startup Change:** The art file has changed, and will probably do see routinely until I can decide"
echo "	  on a more suitable replacement."
echo "	- According to my reading, the corrent buybind for the CZ75 is to use "tec9," so I've updated that."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Space is now CROUCH JUMP, while scroll wheel is still normal."
echo "	  This change took a lot of deliberation, but after much thought I decided that making a toggle"
echo "	  to allow for changing the functionality of the key would take up another key still, and possibly"
echo "	  create unforseen issues. However, this seems too obvious not too have."
echo "	- Removed "unbind *key*" from taunts. While this 'worked,' it wasn't needed and would cause the"
echo "	  key to break if you pressed it while not holding the bind button, requiring a 'redeploy' to"
echo "	  restore the functionality. This corrects the issue. The ones with those places filled in have"
echo "	  other functions attached to the keys."
echo "" 
echo "	#### V14 ####" 
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** When you take out a smoke, be it via 8 or Z; your Q button will switch" 
echo "	  to a 'Smoke Help' button. While holding with a smoke in hand, your Q button (while held) will"
echo "	  change your Crosshair for easy lineups and Space to jumpthrow for easy throws."
echo "	  (This will not work if you don't use 8 or Z to pull out your smoke. For example, if a Smoke"
echo "	   practice map autoswitchs you to Smoke or you have a bind for 'use weapon_smokegrenade'/'slot8'"	  
echo "	   These keys do that, but run an alias to restore Q to it's previous state while other nades or" 
echo "	   or weapons are held.)" 
echo "	- Added HUD section to config."
echo "	- Reverted Start art change because I'm not a fan of how it looks. It's garish and distracting,"
echo "	  not just informative and intersting like I want it to be."
echo "	- **Behavoir Change/Fix:** M is now TeamEquipment again, but remains off by Default."
echo "	- Fixed firther bugs in the Drop buy feature to prevent it from requiring a double tap after."
echo "	  I.e. Use buybinds, release key. Try to use buybinds with drop key, drop key needed two taps"	
echo "	  to work."
echo "	  The addition of a crouch jump script, while holding Q to inspect; is up for debate."
echo "	  This should be pretty easy conceptually, it's just a matter of whether or not I should."
echo "	- Fixed a bug that would occur when releasing the buybinds key before the team buy toggle,"
echo "	  causing team buys to be enabled until the next press and release of team buys. It will"
echo "	  now always start disabled, and work on first press."
echo "	- Removed some aliases that were redundant in buyswitcher.cfg"
echo "	- Good Luck, Have fun. "
