//Just for you 11sosam11.

// Taunt Binds
// Hold down "\" to enable taunts.
// Y U I O P [ ]
// J K L ; ' 
// M < . 

// In concept, this works similarly to the buy binds script. (See buybinds.cfg for original author.) 
// Okay, more like; works exactly the same way. 

// If you want the keys to do something other than taunts when the taunt key is released,
// (though these seem a bit hard to reach, but to each their own.)
// then you need to change the "a" lines to the command you'd like. 
// For some examples, see Y, U and M.
// You may notice they have some extra stuff attached to them. This is because in the case
// of Y and U, you can't have "messagemode" and it's sister 2 command behind an alias. 
// So when you try to use Y and U, it just spams "unknown command: messagemode" in the console.
// This is because of CSGO, nothing I can do about it right now. 

// #### Bind keys to aliases for switching states ####

// #### Bind Y Key ####

alias +y "-allchat; alias ya yb"
alias -y "+allchat; alias ya +allchat"

// #### Bind Y Key ####

alias ub "say You should let your chair play, at least it knows how to support."
alias +u "-teamchat; alias ua ub"
alias -u "+teamchat; alias ua "+teamchat"

// #### Bind I Key ####
alias ia "unbind i"
alias ib "say I'm surprised that you were able hit the 'Install' button."
alias +i "alias ia ib"
alias -i "alias ia unbind i"

// #### Bind J Key ####
alias ja "unbind j"
alias jb "say It's just a joke not a dick, don't take it so hard."
alias +j "alias ja jb"
alias -j "alias ja unbind j"

// #### Bind K Key ####
alias ka "unbind k"
alias kb "say How much did you tag that wall for?"
alias +k "alias ka kb"
alias -k "alias ka unbind k"

// #### Bind L Key ####
alias la "unbind l"
alias lb "say Legend has it that the number 0 was first invented after scientists calculated your chance of doing something useful."
alias +l "alias la lb"
alias -l "alias la unbind l"

// #### Bind ; Key ####
alias semia "unbind semicolon"
alias semib "say You're the type of player to get 3rd place in a 1v1 match"
alias +semi "alias semia semib"
alias -semi "alias semia unbind semicolon"

// #### Bind ' Key ####
alias aposa "unbind '"
alias aposb "say I could swallow bullets and shit out a better spray than that."
alias +apos "alias aposa aposb"
alias -apos "alias aposa unbind '"

// #### Bind M Key ####
alias ma "TeamEquipment"
alias mb "say Damage Given To 'Your Mom' - 100 Guys in 2 Hours"
alias +m "+MOM; alias ma mb"
alias -m "-MOM; alias ma TeamEquipment"

// #### Special Treatment for Above ####
alias +MOM con_filter_text_out " : Damage"
alias -MOM con_filter_text_out " : "

// ##Explanation on what:## For some reason the commands associated with the aliases 
// below don't function in their place. GO will run both, but ignore the latter's
// "Player:" variable even though it shows it set in the console. 
// Adding these seems to solve that issue. Try it yourself if you're tinkering. 
// (06/2/2018, so maybe they'll fix it. Seems like a backend issue.)
// ##Explanation on why:## It's because I wanted to filter out the "player : your name" line
// from the display damage script like every other script does. The reason this wasn't happening
// was for a "bug fix" to stop the "Damage given to 'Your Mom'" from appearing as legitimate damage.
// This takes it a step further by using that fix when the taunts key is held down, and the other when
// the key is released.
